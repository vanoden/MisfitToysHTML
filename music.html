				<h2 class="title">The Music</h2>
				<p> Members of the Misfit Toys Band grew up listening to songs from the 80's and 90's.  Watching MTV when they had music videos and listening to the radio when they played music.
					We partied during the days of the alternative rock explosion and the grunge movement.  But we also got hooked on Progressive Rock, Hair Metal and more.
				</p>
				<p>	Our set lists include songs with an edge and a lot of energy that are sometimes more difficult to play and not as often covered.
					Our goal is to play music that is a little more challenging and interesting but still available and attention grabbing.
					We are always adding new songs to our set list, so check back often to see what we've added.
